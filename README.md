The processing pipeline is outlined in Jupyter notebook file.
Change `'path/to/image/files'` string in it with proper path to directory with tiff files. Moreover, use the proper path to ImageJ jar file `ij.jar` in jython files of helpers directory.

If you need any help with using the tools, please contact ivan.erofeev@ed.ac.uk.
